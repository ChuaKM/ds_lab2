# ds_lab_2

The program uses a recursive algorithm to compute the determinant of an nxn matrix. 
- Iterate through an input file, check the validity of its components
- Create a Matrix ADT to manipulate the input matrix
- Calculate the cofactor and determinant of each input matrix (using laplace expansion)
- Write the results to an output file in a cogent format
