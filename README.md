# ds_lab_2

The program uses a recursive algorithm to compute the determinant of an nxn matrix. 
- Iterating through an input file, checking the validity of its components
- Creating our own Matrix ADT to be used to manipulate the input matrix
- Calculating the cofactor and determinant of each input matrix (uses laplace expansion)
- Writing the results in a cogent format for review
